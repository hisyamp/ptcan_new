On the other hand, palm shells are also durable when used in the combustion process. In addition, palm shells can also be used as a mixture of livestock feed and a mixture of road paving materials"

            "body2":"The table above is the results of the LAB (Sucofindo) from Palm Shell Waste that we usually present, with the following conclusions; - Total Moisture / Moisture Content By containing a moisture content (moisture in Analysis) of 17.82% (Air Dried Basis) at least makes the palm shells very suitable for fuel. Because, basically, the less the intensity of the water content in something, the easier it is to burn. In addition, the condition of this water content also determines the quality (durability and strength). - Ash Content It has a low ash content, which is approximately 2-3%, making it very suitable to replace coal. By using palm shells as charcoal fuel, at least it is very helpful in preserving limited natural resources. In addition, using palm oil shells further empowers renewable resource stocks. - Volatile Matter / Evaporation Level The intensity of the evaporation rate is quite high, (volatile matter), which is around 69-80%. If so, this means that using palm shells will be far more friendly to the surrounding environment. This is because the oil palm shells contain relatively low levels of carbon sulfur, thereby reducing air pollution, as the original purpose of using biomass energy was. It is different when an industry uses coal or natural resource fuels which will cause high pollution"
